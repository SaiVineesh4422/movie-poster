            In Saurashtra in 1998, a young Michael is obsessed with superheroes, and frequently masquerades as one. While hanging out with his friend Siri, he tries jumping flying off the terrace of his home but injures himself, earning the ire of his parents. A while later, Michael is shown to be watching on as his parents die in a fire inside their home.

In the present day, Michael, now an admired superhero in Mumbai through the help of Siri's innovations, christens himself as "Mega Man" and thwarts a burglary attempt while killing the robbers but gets injured in the process. His injuries make him yearn to possess a power that would make him a real and formidable superhero.

Anjanadri, a dystopian hamlet, is agonized under the tyranny of the polygar, Gajapathi. Hanumanthu, a petty thief in Anjanadri, has a huge crush on Meenakshi. She constantly combats Gajapathi's oppression, prompting him to launch a false bandit attack on her. Hanumanthu manages to avert the ambush and rescue Meenakshi, but is severely wounded and falls into the sea. While underwater, he gets hold of a strange glowing gem. Meanwhile, Meenakshi pines to uncover the identity of her savior, who has been aiding her since childhood.</div>
